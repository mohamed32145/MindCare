**Step 1: Data Organization**

The dataset was first organized into the following diagnostic groups:

* **CN** (Cognitively Normal)
* **MCI** ( Mild Cognitive Impairment)
* **AD** (Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease)
---

 Image Selection Criteria

 For the AD and CN groups:

* We retained only the images with the following preprocessing pipeline:
  `MPR-R__GradWarp__B1_Correction__N3__Scaled` or
  `MPR__GradWarp__B1_Correction__N3__Scaled`.

* Images labeled with `*_scaled_2*` were removed.
  These images were adjusted to disable scaling on axes where the phantom's measurements are considered unreliable.
  While `*_scaled_2*` images may offer higher accuracy, they are significantly fewer in number and **cannot be mixed** with the standard `*_scaled*` images for model training due to consistency issues.

---

 For the MCI

* Due to the limited availability of subjects in these groups, we included:

  * `MPR-R__GradWarp__B1_Correction__N3__Scaled`
  * `MPR__GradWarp__B1_Correction__N3__Scaled`
  * `MPR__GradWarp__N3__Scaled`

* Subjects with only `MPR__GradWarp__N3__Scaled` images will undergo additional preprocessing, specifically:

  *Bias field correction, to reduce intensity non-uniformity and improve image quality before training.
