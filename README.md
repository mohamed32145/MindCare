# ðŸ§  Early Detection of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Using Multi-Modal Deep Learning

##  Project Objective

This project aims to assist clinicians in the **early detection of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD)** by predicting the **conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD** using a **multi-modal deep learning approach**. Accurate and early prediction can improve treatment planning, monitoring, and quality of life for patients at risk.

## ðŸ—‚ Data Source: ADNI1

The **Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI1)** dataset is a highly regarded and publicly available resource for neuroimaging research. It provides rich longitudinal data suitable for modeling disease progression.

For this project, we will use:

* **Longitudinal 1.5T structural MRI scans**
* **Cognitive and clinical assessment data**

These data types will be **combined** to provide a more holistic view of patient trajectories, improving the modelâ€™s predictive power.

##  Data Preprocessing

###  MRI Data:

* **Skull Stripping** using FSL BET to isolate brain regions.
* **Bias Field Correction** (if required) using ANTs or SimpleITK.
* **Resampling** to a common voxel size (e.g., 1x1x1 mmÂ³) for spatial uniformity.
* **Reshaping** all images to a fixed 3D shape (e.g., 128Ã—128Ã—128).
* **Longitudinal Registration** to align scans across time points for each subject.

###  Tabular (Clinical) Data:

* **Numerical Features**: Standardization or min-max normalization.
* **Categorical Features**: One-hot encoding or label encoding.

All preprocessing is performed with automation scripts and quality control checkpoints.

##  Proposed Model Architecture

The model will adopt a **multi-modal, temporal-aware architecture** that integrates imaging and clinical data.

###  MRI Modality:

* **2D/3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to extract spatial features.
* **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** layers to model temporal progression across multiple visits.

###  Cognitive & Clinical Modality:

* **LSTM or MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)** networks to process time-sequenced clinical records.

###  Fusion:

* Feature embeddings from both modalities will be **fused** (concatenation or attention-based fusion) before the final classification layer.
