this will be done by analyzing mri scnas images ,

The Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease (MIRIAD) dataset is a series of longitudinal volumetric T1 MRI scans of 46 mild-moderate Alzheimer's subjects and 23 controls. It is made available for researchers to develop, validate and compare techniques, particularly for measurement of longitudinal volume change in serially acquired MR. With thanks to GlaxoSmithKline, the UK Alzheimer's society and the Medical Research Council.

OASIS-2 :https://sites.wustl.edu/oasisbrains/home/oasis-2/
This set consists of a longitudinal collection of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. Each subject was scanned on two or more visits, separated by at least one year for a total of 373 imaging sessions. For each subject, 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained in single scan sessions are included. The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 72 of the subjects were characterized as nondemented throughout the study. 64 of the included subjects were characterized as demented at the time of their initial visits and remained so for subsequent scans, including 51 individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Another 14 subjects were characterized as nondemented at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as demented at a later visit.
